**Project overview:** <br>
Making video games is a passion of mine, and it helps me apply the things that I have learned in computer science classes in a way that is meaningful to me. I have done all the development of my games in C# in the Visual Studio Code IDE using the Unity game engine. Most of my projects have been to challenge myself and experiment with different concepts. Some of the games that I've made include a side-scrolling parkour game, a virtual reality bowling game, and a 2D top-down shooter game made with no external plugins. These projects have improved my problem-solving abilities and, of course, my coding expertise.
