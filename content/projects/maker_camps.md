**Project overview:**
The George Fox Maker Camps are hosted by a group on campus called the Engineering Ambassadors. The Engineering Ambassadors are all students in engineering at George Fox who want to help students of all ages learn about STEM and engineering. I am one of the 5 leaders that plan and coordinate events with schools in the areas. 

As for the Maker Camps, they are done over the summer and cater towards high school students who are interested in engineering. There are usually 2-3 camps per summer. Each of the camps is usually based on a different focus in engineering, for example, this last year we did 3 camps. One of the camps had the students create automatons, which is a mechanical engineering focus. The other two camps were based on hydraulics and sensors, targeting civil engineering and computer/electrical engineering respectively.

This last summer, I was one of the staff members that was present for all 3 of the camps. For the last camp that was focused on sensors, I was the lead coding instructor, showing the campers how to program Arduinos and make circuits. For this job, I was also in charge of making interactive examples to demonstrate what each sensor does in a fun way. The image on the left is of 3 of the demo pieces that I made for this camp.
