**Project overview:**
Cars are probably what originally sparked my interest in engineering. I started modifying my cars as soon as I got my first car at 16. Since then, I have acquired 3 cars and each of them has had a tremendous amount of work put into it. I've done everything from replacing headlight bulbs to full engine rebuilds on these cars. The car in the picture to the left is a 1992 VW Jetta that has a VR6 engine swap. I also have a 1993 Eagle Talon TSI AWD which I am in the process of rebuilding the engine on. As for my daily driver, I have a 2002 Subaru WRX, which was my first car, and sparked my interest in cars and engineering in general. These cars are a way for me to take my problem-solving skills from engineering school and apply them to real life projects. Knowing how to do repairs myself has saved me thousands of dollars in repairs and has taught me a great deal about how these machines work.
