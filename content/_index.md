My name is Jack Sides, I'm from Beaverton Oregon, and I'm a Sophomore at George Fox University. I'm studying both Computer Engineering and Computer Science in a dual degree.

I have experience in several programming languages including Scala, Java, Python, and Verilog to name a few. I've taken classes in topics such as Data Structures, Digital Logic Design, Analysis of Algorithms, and various other engineering and computer science focused classes. 

In addition to software, I have also learned to build and analyze electrical circuits. I've learned how to use circuit design software such as KiCad, and also how to use oscilloscopes, power supplies, multimeters, and function generators.

During my freshman year in engineering, I also learned skills and software associated with other disciplines of engineering. Some of these skills include 3D modeling in SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360, CNC and manual machining, and rapid prototyping.

Iâ€™ve also had several work study jobs on campus at George Fox in the engineering department including a summer position as a maker hub assistant, where I designed and built several projects for other departments in the school. I also have industry experience in engineering as a field service engineer at the biomedical company Carrot Medical, where I would go to hospitals and repair/recall Philips V60 ventilators. While at Carrot Medical, I learned how to effectively communicate with customers, create and fill out work orders, and communicate while working remotely with other employees and managers.
