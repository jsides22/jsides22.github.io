My name is Jack Sides, I'm from Beaverton, Oregon, and I'm a Junior at George Fox University. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

I have programmed in a large range of functional and object-oriented programming languages such as Scala, Java, Python and C#. I also have experience in low-level and hardware design languages such as C, Verilog, and Assembly.

In addition to software engineering, I have also learned to build and analyze electrical circuits. I've learned how to use circuit design software such as KiCad and Altium Designer, and also how to use oscilloscopes, power supplies, multimeters, and function generators to test and debug hardware.

Aside from electronics and programming, I have also learned skills and software associated with other disciplines of engineering including 3D modeling in SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360, CNC and manual machining, and rapid prototyping.

In terms of coursework, I've taken classes such as Data Structures, Digital Logic Design, Analysis of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Microprocessor Architecture, Embedded System Design, Electrical Signals and Networks, and various other engineering and computer science focused classes. 

My first job in the field of engineering was with a company called Carrot Medical, where I worked as a Biomedical Field Service Engineer, going to hospitals and repairing medical equipment. In this job, I learned several skills that are fundamental to engineering such as diagnosing software and hardware issues in machines, communicating with customers, and creating, filling out, and submitting work orders. Once I started going to school, I quickly found my way into several on-campus jobs, including managing a makerspace's tool inventory, working as a machine shop aid, and working as a TA for classes such as Intro to Engineering and Digital Logic Design. Most recently, over the summer of 2024, I worked as an intern for NanoVox, LLC. In this internship, I was placed on a team of scientists working on lens 3D printing technology. My job consisted of many different projects over the summer, including building new visualization software to generate colormaps and 3D models of lenses and their refraction indexes, using metaheuristic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems, and working with a professional in the inkjet printing field to create a complex error diffusion algorithm for the printers. After the internship, I was hired as a part-time Staff Scientist to work remotely during the school year.
